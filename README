pinpoint
--------

Pinpoint a simple presentation tool that hopes to avoid audience death by
bullet point and instead encourage presentations containing beautiful images
and small amounts of concise text in slides.

Pinpoints main web-presence is a page in the GNOME wiki:

 http://live.gnome.org/Pinpoint

This is the first release of pinpoint, with the following features:

 • Text position
 • Styling of font, text-color, contrast background and text positioning for
   global default and per slide overrides.
 • Image backgrounds
 • Video backgrounds
 • Pango markup inside slides
 • Transitions, extendable through json
 • PDF export
 • Embedding commands to run for demos in slides, with editable commandline
   during presentation.
 • Monitoring of source file with live updates of changed slide for authoring


The following illustrates what a pinpoint presentation looks like, for a more
exhaustive overview of pinpoints features see the included sample presentation.
